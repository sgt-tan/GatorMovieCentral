  <h1>Side-By-Side Positioning Demo</h1>
  <div class="ib">These two divs are positioned next to one another using <code>display: inline-block</code></div>
  <div class="ib">Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.</div>
  <br />
  <div class="float">These two are positioned using <code>float: left.</code></div>
  <div class="float">You can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...</div>
  <br />  
  <div class="ib half">What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%, right?</div>
  <div class="ib half">Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.</div>
  <br />  
  <div class="float half">If I do the same thing with floated elements...</div>
  <div class="float half">The two elements are side-by-side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which, in this case, is the same as the width of the viewport.</div>
